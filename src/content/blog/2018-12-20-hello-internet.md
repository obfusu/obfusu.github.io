I have been wandering around for the past 6 years, trying out different stuff for writing content. Started my journey with the good old LAMP hosting (Apache + PHP + MySQL), with a nice cozy blogging engine called [nibbleblog](http://www.nibbleblog.com). Though they gave me a bizarre site url (thanks to free hosting and subdomain), direct access to PHP made me feel like a ninja and was loving it. But sadly, they shut it down for my country and all my data was lost.

So I began evaluating different options. Voila. Github offered its own free static site hosting called [github pages](https://pages.github.com). With jekyll, markdown, a plethora of frontend frameworks and the awesome â€œ.github.io" free subdomain, this was a dream come true. But over time, moving out from college and getting into a job, I realised time was another important factor and wanted to try something that focussed more on content. I tried [wordpress](https://wordpress.com), but the ads annoyed me. Tried [weebly](https://weebly.com), but somehow felt constrained. Then I stumbled upon [medium](https://medium.com). It was good. But down the line, they changed so many of their policies and I decided its best to avoid any kind of possible surprises. I finally decided on [blogger](https://blogger.com), but I guess by now they removed all the nice features which was offered earlier. 

Thus after overthinking a lot, I finally settled on jekyll with github pages. Its pro developer friendly and I hope it will continue to do so. In this blog, I intend to write mostly on technology, with a few covering my travel experiences and as and when my mind permits some of the most offbeat topics. So that's about it for my first post. See you again soon!
