  I moved my blog from Jekyll to Astro
---

So finally, after a slow and tedious mentally painful process, I decided to use
[Astro](https://astro.build) - the next whatever next-gen static site
generator.

Seriously frontend tooling has been over the edge in the past few years,
with so many *next-gen* stuff popping out of nowhere. Astro was not on my list,
and I very much wanted to avoid something as warm-blooded
([cold-blooded software](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38793206))
as Astro.

### Before that, why did I decide to move away from Jekyll?

Jekyll meant extra tooling for me. As it is I'm fed up dealing with multiple
versions of node.js, python, java and a host of other software. I didn't want
another rbenv, rvm and a messed up apt repo with ruby and rubygems installed
nor deal with some of the nokogiri compilation issues that pops up randomly.
I wanted a simpler solution. Something like [bashblog](https://github.com/cfenollosa/bashblog).

### My requirements were

- As little bloat as possible, eg. no npm, no webpack, etc
- Minimum or single static binary tooling which I don't have to maintain for years together
- A clear and legible apperance, with accessibility out of box, like for example [Cupper](https://thepaciellogroup.github.io/cupper/)

> Unsurprisingly after careful considerations, just like most corporate decisions I decided to use
something which couldn't get any furthur away from my original requirements.

### Why Astro?

Astro stood out in one aspect. It was fast. There was no competetion. Bashblog was fast.
But Astro was faster. This was baffling. How could a static html website be slower than
something with more javascript and markup like an astro site?
On digging around, I noticed that as soon as I hover over a link,
Astro prefetches the page even before I click on it.

Apart from speed, Astro was convenient to me in other ways. It used node.js which is my
comfy tool, had github action to deploy to github-pages and was SEO friendly.
Migrating was a piece of cake since my old blog was already in markdown.

And thus even though I wanted a lesser maintenance tool, this blog shall be in Astro at least till package.json breaks.
